Wish List Items for NSCA-ng
===========================

The wish list items are listed in no particular order.

- Let the server support command authorization based on host and service
  groups.  This requires the server to actually parse the submitted
  commands, as oppposed to simply matching them against the user-supplied
  regular expressions.

- Let the server support proxying of (selected or all) data (with `forward`
  blocks in the configuration, for example).

- Support requests for status and configuration data in order to provide a
  full-blown remote API.

- Let the client execute standard Nagios plugins directly (as an alternative
  to using a script such as `contrib/invoke_check`), and maybe provide a
  daemon mode with poor man's check scheduling (i.e., add `check_interval`
  and `retry_interval` directives to the client configuration).

- Port the client to Microsoft Windows.

- Create a client library with Perl (and maybe Python) bindings.
