NSCA-ng Release History
=======================

Changes in Release 1.2 (2013-11-06)
-----------------------------------

- Let nsca-ng.cfg(5)'s `include` directive and nsca-ng(8)'s `-c` flag accept
  directory path names.  If a directory is specified, read the server
  configuration from all `*.cfg` and `*.conf` files in the specified
  directory and all subdirectories.
- Let the client's `-d` and `-e` flags accept C-style escape sequences, so
  that e.g. `-e '\n'` can be specified.  Octal and hexadecimal numbers are
  also accepted.
- Allow for specifying authorization settings outside of the `authorize`
  sections in nsca-ng.cfg(5) files.  They will then serve as a fallback for
  `authorize` sections that don't define these settings.
- Fix a race condition in the case where the command file is recreated after
  the NSCA-ng server had opened it.
- Fix a crash of the client on 32-bit platforms that use 64-bit timestamps.
- Don't use half-broken POSIX AIO implementations such as the one provided
  by Debian GNU/kFreeBSD 7.
- Apply test suite fixes for GNU Hurd.
- Update our copy of libev from version 4.11 to version 4.15.  The new
  release provides a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements.
- Apply some minor cleanups.

Changes in Release 1.1 (2013-04-12)
-----------------------------------

- Add chroot(2) support to the server.
- Let the server accept `hosts` patterns in `authorize` sections.  They're
  syntactic sugar for allowing host checks to be submitted (analogous to the
  `services` patterns for service check submissions).
- Let the client ignore empty input lines.  This fixes some corner cases
  where NSCA-ng's client didn't accept the same input as the client provided
  with the original NSCA package.
- Add the `-e` client option, which allows for specifying a delimiter to use
  instead of the ASCII ETB character for separating check results.
- Let the `invoke_check` script (provided in the `contrib` directory of the
  source tarball) survive plugin return codes other than zero.  This should
  make the script slightly more useful :-)
- Apply a few minor improvements.

Changes in Release 1.0 (2013-03-06)
-----------------------------------

- Actually use the POSIX AIO API if it's provided by the target system.  The
  corresponding Autoconf test was broken since version 0.2.
- When opening the command file, check whether it's a named pipe.  If it's
  not, log a warning message and retry opening it later on.
- Use the PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA cipher suite (instead of PSK-RC4-SHA) by
  default.
- Apply various minor fixes and improvements.

Changes in Release 0.3 (2013-02-25)
-----------------------------------

- First public release.
- Fix the server's `-s` and `-S` options.  They were effectively ignored.
- Mention the session ID in all log messages related to the TLS
  communication in order to ease debugging.
- Apply a few minor cleanups.

Changes in Release 0.2 (2013-02-19, Unpublished)
------------------------------------------------

- Accept non-numeric service check result status when matching against
  service patterns.
- Don't accept spurious service check results.  This could have happened
  when service patterns without host name part were specified.
- Mention the session ID when refusing data.
- Fix the client's `-s` option.  It was effectively ignored.
- Don't link the client against the libraries used only by the server.
- Apply various minor cleanups.

Changes in Release 0.1 (2013-02-08, Unpublished)
------------------------------------------------

- Initial release.
